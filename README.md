<div align='center'><h3>ü§î What is Jmorph? ü§î</h3></div>
<p>Jmorph is a third party software that allows players in a game called 'World of Warcraft' to change and customize their appearances without having to actually change it in the ordinary way. However, the change made by the software can only be seen by the user's and not by other players, which makes Jmorph a usefull tool when it comes to changing the player's style at anytime wanted!</p>
<hr/>
<div align='center'><h3>üòÅ How can i download it? üòÅ</h3></div>
<p>Jmorph can be downloaded at this <a href='https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-bots-programs/795619-jmorph-tmorph-morpher-recreated.html'>website</a>. Remember that you also need to have installed 'World of Warcraft' game, because this tool is designed for it.</p>
<hr/>
<div align='center'><h3>üëª Why did you made this script? üëª</h3></div>
<p>World of Warcraft is a game with a long history now, and part of that history includes updates, and a lot of them! Everytime the game got updated i had to re-download the jMorph tool (once the owner had updated it as well), had to move it to my World of Warcraft's folder, had to unzip it and create a shortcut to the desktop area. All of these steps could be automated and thats how i came up with the idea.</p>
<hr/>
<div align='center'><h3>ü§î Will the script work for me as well? ü§î</h3></div>
<p>Since i made the script based on my directory folder, the script it's not going to work if you don't make a couple changes in it. I'll show you what parts you have to change if you want to use it too.</p>
